ap photo more photos     by paul glader associated press writer  february 13, 2002       san francisco (ap) -- frank crosetti came from the same italian-american neighborhood as joe dimaggio and wore new york yankees  pinstripes for 36 years.   crosetti, who died monday night at 91, played shortstop for 17 seasons in new york, alongside yankees greats including babe ruth, lou gehrig and joe dimaggio, then coached third base for 20 more years. he collected enough world series rings for all his fingers and toes, as yankees manager joe torre once joked.   actually, crosetti won a total of 17 world series championships as a player or coach.   ``he was yankee all the way around. we had no other team. he only played with the yankees,'' said his wife of 63 years, norma.   crosetti, who remained remarkably healthy late in life, died of complications from a fall in early january, norma crosetti said.   playing on eight yankees world series championship teams from 1932 to 1948, crosetti had a career batting average of .245 with 98 home runs and 649 runs batted in.   his best year may have been 1938, when he led the american league with 27 stolen bases. his 757 plate appearances that year set a major league record for a 154-game season.   ``he was a true yankee,'' team spokesman rick cerrone said.   nicknamed ``the crow,'' crosetti was known for old-school tactics such as stealing the opposing team's signs from the dugout, hiding a baseball to tag out a base runner and getting on base by purposely getting hit by pitches.   he was also present for some of baseball's major events, including ruth's home run in the 1932 world series against the chicago cubs . crosetti claimed ruth wasn't calling his shot, but pointing to the chicago bench. he was also there for lou gehrig's good-bye in 1939, and for the last time ruth put on his no. 3 uniform in 1948.   after retiring in 1948, crosetti was the yankees' third-base coach for 20 years, taking part in 15 more world series.   ``he didn't take the game home with him, win or lose,'' said his son, john crosetti of san diego. ``losses didn't bother him. he was a yankee. he expected to win the world series, and they kind of did.''   crosetti was born oct. 4, 1910, in san francisco, where he grew up in north beach, where the dimaggio brothers -- joe, vince and dominic -- also lived.   as a boy, crosetti sometimes played doubleheader sandlot games, starting at his north beach neighborhood before hopping on a bus to oakland for more competition. later, he'd do the same for the minor league seals in doubleheaders against the rival oakland oaks.   another italian-american from san francisco, tony lazzeri, made it to the yankees first, followed by crosetti and five years later by dimaggio.   he rarely opened up with reporters, and in retirement, seemed to prefer hunting and fishing to baseball. ``he preferred being low-key and out of the spotlight,'' his son said.   still, he graciously gave autographs when fans stopped by his house or approached him at games, and he never charged, his son said.   crosetti would often stop by the yankees clubhouse when the team visited the bay area to play the athletics. he and his wife attended one yankees game in oakland this year before his eyesight started to fail.   private services were set for friday in san francisco.   email this story  - (view most popular)
ap photo more photos     by mel reisner ap sports writer  february 13, 2002       phoenix (ap) -- the offseason was short for the arizona diamondbacks , who won the world series in just their fourth year of existence.   less time off amounted to greater anticipation of a title defense, and spring training is finally here. pitchers and catchers arrive thursday in tucson and conduct their first workout friday.   ``i think the majority of the guys would tell you this offseason just kind of flew by,'' outfielder luis gonzalez  said. ``at the same time, we're anxious to get going again. we all want to get started. that's the fun part, when everybody gets back together and can tell their war stories and what they did in the offseason.''   a repeat, always difficult, will be even more so because of the team's age -- aces randy johnson  and curt schilling  are 38 and 34, respectively, third baseman matt williams  is 36 and first baseman mark grace  is 37. the diamondbacks also have to overcome the loss of reggie sanders  to free agency, whose 33 home runs were second only to gonzalez's 57.   but optimism is the universal state of mind in mid-february, and arizona -- still basking in the glow of the victory over the new york yankees  in a world series that didn't end until nov. 4 -- isn't ready to call it impossible.   ``we had time off to enjoy the spectacular season we had last year,'' grace said. ``now it's up to us and the veteran guys to make sure it's just that -- last year. we have targets on our backs, but it's a good feeling to be the team to beat, and i think we are.''   johnson and schilling finished last season in excellent health, todd stottlemyre  has been throwing easily after missing last season because of a malfunctioning nerve in his pitching shoulder and closer matt mantei  is on schedule to return from elbow ligament surgery by may or june.   the diamondbacks failed to sign david wells  after a handshake agreement between wells and owner jerry colangelo, but added durable rick helling  to the rotation and added left-hander mike myers  to the bullpen.   ``i'm more excited that we got myers than helling,'' gonzalez said. ``as a left-handed hitter, picking up one of the best left-handed relievers was good. but helling is a solid player. he's always been consistent, he never misses a start and it's exciting for our team to get a guy like that.''   after the full squad arrives early next week, the diamondbacks will begin working through the question marks.   they will try to replace sanders with world series hero danny bautista , who got a $9 million, three-year contract to make sure he didn't look elsewhere.   bautista, 29, batted .364 in the postseason and went 7-for-12 against the yankees, including 5-for-8 with six rbis in the last two games. but he hasn't been a full-time starter since 2000.   jose guilllen, another offseason addition, erubiel durazo  and david dellucci  also are available for work in right field.   ``the reason for the short offseason was the long postseason, so we're not complaining about it,'' manager bob brenly said. ``we did have to cram a lot of the things that took us all winter last year into a very short period of time to get ready for this spring, but i think we're ready to go.''   email this story  - (view most popular)
ap photo more photos     by rick eymer associated press writer  february 12, 2002       san francisco (ap) -- tsuyoshi shinjo , the outfielder the san francisco giants  acquired from the new york mets  during the offseason, made his first visit to pac bell park on tuesday.   he liked what he saw.   ``it's an interesting field,'' said shinjo, expected to lead off and play center field. ``there's a deep right-center, and i love to chase the ball. it's a field made for me.''   speaking through an interpreter, shinjo said he's looking forward to playing in san francisco, contrary to reports he was unhappy to leave the mets.   ``i just didn't think about getting traded,'' shinjo said. ``in japan, it's unusual to trade big-name players. i was just surprised. i love san francisco. i'm happy to be here.''   since the ``tsu'' in his first name is hard for americans to pronounce, shinjo said he could be referred to by his last name or ``just plain joe if it's easier for americans.''   giants general manager brian sabean admitted part of the reason for acquiring shinjo was to extend the giants identity into the far east.   ``we have the ability to spread the giants name, and this could give us the ability to have other dealings in japan,'' he said. ``he means a lot to us globally.''   shinjo is the second japanese player with the giants. left-handed pitcher masanori murakami was the first in the majors when he signed with the giants in 1964.   ``i met murakami last year, and on my tour of the stadium i saw his picture,'' shinjo said. ``he was eating his first hot dog ever in the united states. i was impressed with the pictures. i want the giants to put up a picture of me eating a sandwich or something.''   shinjo, who played all 10 years in japan with hanshin, batted .268 with 10 home runs in 118 games with the mets last year. he was the second japanese position player to ever sign a major league contract, behind seattle's ichiro suzuki .   ``my biggest concern is building relationships with my teammates,'' shinjo said. ``it's not easy to play in the united states, and i want to get along with my teammates.''   shinjo has never batted leadoff, but he doesn't think it will be much of a transition.   ``it doesn't matter to me, i'll hit fourth even,'' he said. ``i just want to do what's best for the team. i want to play steady all season. hopefully i can play 162 games and put up better numbers.''   shinjo, a four-time all-star in japan and a seven-time gold glove winner, spoke briefly with left fielder barry bonds  during a clubhouse tour.   ``he said he would play straight up and let me take all the balls to left-center,'' shinjo said.   email this story  - (view most popular)
ap photo more photos     by michael marot ap sports writer  february 13, 2002       indianapolis (ap) -- isiah thomas is weary of watching his team get beaten up inside.   so on tuesday night, he addressed the source of his frustration.   the indiana coach criticized his team after karl malone  ripped the pacers for 34 points, 14 rebounds, six assists and five steals in leading the utah jazz  to a 98-82 victory.   ``i felt we were very soft, and i'm not a soft guy,'' thomas said. ``however, you can't make people something that they're not. you can't ask for toughness when a guy's not that. we've got some pretty players, but we need some dogs.''   the pacers couldn't find anybody to stop malone & co., who played more like the nba title contenders they once were.   malone made 11 of 23 field-goal attempts and 12 of 16 free throws, while john stockton  had nine points, 12 assists and six steals.   the supporting cast was every bit as good. reserve forward scott padgett  matched his career high with 17 points, and andrei kirilenko  had 10 points and nine rebounds as the jazz snapped a two-game losing streak.   ``i think it was a great effort by everybody,'' malone said. ``when they made runs, we kept doing what we're capable of doing, making them pay with switches.''   reserve guard travis best  scored a team-high 18 points for the pacers, who dropped their third straight.   while the jazz kept finding players who could wreak havoc on the inside, indiana struggled to find anybody to match up with malone. utah had a 50-34 rebounding advantage, including 17-7 on the offensive end.   ``that's where we're at right now,'' thomas said. ``when we play against bigger, stronger teams, we just don't have enough.''   thomas' players didn't contest the comments, but didn't receive them warmly, either.   ``that's tough to say about your team,'' said jalen rose , who had 16 points and six assists. ``those are tough pickings, tough words.''   indiana was playing short-handed after placing backup forward carlos rogers  on the suspended list because he did not return following the all-star break. thomas said he believed rogers was attending to ``personal family matters,'' but he called the absence unexcused.   even with rogers, however, thomas had seen this kind of power basketball dominate his team before.   ``we're just a very soft team right now, we're not strong enough inside,'' he said. ``you can't ask jeff (foster) and jermaine (o'neal) to be the only guys to rebound.''   indiana, which hadn't played since feb. 5, got off to a poor start. the pacers shot 23.5 percent from the field in the first quarter and fell behind 22-13.   the jazz went on a 14-3 run to open a 48-36 halftime lead -- with 24 points scored in the paint.   the pacers used a 13-1 spurt to pull to 63-57 late in the third quarter. but utah regained control by closing the period on a 9-3 run and never gave indiana another opportunity to rally -- primarily because the jazz continued to get easy baskets.   ``they're experienced inside and that really hurts us,'' thomas said. ``we have experience on the perimeter, but we don't have experience inside so wehave men going against young guys all the time.'' notes  utah, on a nine-game road trip, returns home after the olympics. ... indiana is 5-6 against western conference teams at conseco fieldhouse this season, and 18-17 since opening 14-0 at home against the west three years ago. ... jazz c greg ostertag  served a one-game suspension for bumping coach jerrysloan last wednesday against memphis.   email this story  - (view most popular)

ap photo more photos     by george henry associated press writer  february 13, 2002       atlanta (ap) -- jason kidd  promises that he won't let the new jersey nets  get overconfident.   ``every team we face is gunning for us, and we have to play each game with the same intensity we showed in the first half,'' kidd said. ``we saw what happens when you let a hungry team stay close and then take the momentum.''   kidd missed a straightaway 3-pointer at the buzzer in the nets' 105-103 loss to the atlanta hawks  on tuesday night. the all-star guard also was called for the foul that sent jason terry  to the free-throw line with 4.4 seconds remaining.   ``give them credit,'' kidd said. ``they hit the shots when they needed them, but that doesn't mean we should feel any better about our performance. we blew it.''   new jersey, which had a seven-point lead with 3:28 remaining, allowed dermarr johnson  to tie it at 103 with a 3-pointer -- his only basket of the second half -- with 50 seconds remaining.   the nets, who lead the eastern conference with a 32-16 record, failed to score on their next two possessions. terry hit the go-ahead free throw after dribbling past kerry kittles  and getting fouled by kidd, who nearly stole jacque vaughn 's inbounds pass just seconds earlier.   shareef abdur-rahim  led the hawks with 34 points, hitting all 16 of his free throws. terry added 28 points, and johnson had a career-high 21 for atlanta, which has won three of four and improved to 44-12 at home against the nets.   the hawks, who entered with a 16-33 record that put them on pace to match last season's franchise-worst 25-57 mark, improved to just 4-21 when an opponent scores 100 points. atlanta essentially won the game at the free-throw line, hitting 18 of 24 attempts in the second half.   ``it feels good to go out there and get rewarded for a good effort,'' abdur-rahim said. ``it all starts with playing defense. if we do that, other things fall in place.''   new jersey had won two straight and three of four from the hawks, but the nets missed their last three shots, including kidd's 12-foot baseline jumper that vaughn rebounded with 14.9 seconds left.   kittles led the nets with 20 points. keith van horn  added 16, and richard jefferson  had 15. van horn, jefferson and center todd macculloch  each had five fouls, and kenyon martin , who played the second half with a sore wrist, had four.   kidd, who has an nba-best five triple-doubles, finished with 12 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists.   kidd hit a fadeaway 16-footer to put new jersey ahead 103-100 with 1:24 go, and atlanta's nazr mohammed  missed two fouls shots.   new jersey, which has dropped two straight for the first time since dec. 21-22, led by as many as 10 points -- the last time in the third quarter whenkidd hit van horn with a behind-the-back pass. notes  atlanta hopes to get f toni kukoc  back next week. kukoc had the cast removed from his right wrist, which he broke jan. 9. ... coach lon kruger said after the game that f alan henderson , who's missed the entire season with an inflamed right knee, could return sometime during a six-game west coast road trip that begins friday against the lakers. ... on thursday, the nets will attempt to win consecutive games over the pistons for the first time since april 18, 1998-february 15, 1999. new jersey ended a seven-year winless streakat detroit with an 88-75 victory on dec. 27.   email this story  - (view most popular)
ap photo more photos       february 13, 2002       auburn hills, mich. (ap) -- the phoenix suns  have struggled often this season when holding big leads at the half.   they didn't have a problem at all on tuesday night.   the suns led the detroit pistons  by 15 points at halftime and turned the advantage into a 99-71 victory.   ``we've had some games where we've blown big leads, and we didn't want to do that again,'' said penny hardaway, who had 10 points, eight rebounds and five assists. ``we slack off defensively and let teams get up the floor and into their offense.   ``tonight, we took the game away from them at the beginning of the second half.''   suns coach scott skiles said he warned his team against a letdown.   ``we talked about it at the half because we've lost some games when we had big leads at the half,'' he said. ``but tonight, we made the complete game that we needed. we were exceptional on both ends of the floor.''   detroit went into the all-star break having won three straight and 10 of 13, but the momentum didn't survive the time off.   ``i thought we were going to play very well, but i was wrong,'' pistons coach rick carlisle said. ``we got beat every way possible.''   jerry stackhouse  and corliss williamson  led detroit with 10 points each as the pistons set a franchise record for fewest points in a home game.   ``when you don't put the ball in the basket, things like that are going to happen,'' stackhouse said. ``we didn't play hard, and we didn't deserve to win. even if we had won, we wouldn't have deserved it.''   skiles said he was surprised by the pistons' play, but he could understand it.   ``they were just a step slow on both ends of the floor,'' he said. ``they were playing great before the break, and this certainly isn't indicative of that level of play. games like this happen coming out of the break.''   but they don't happen to the suns. skiles has a 21-8 record in february since taking over as the phoenix coach.   ``there are only a couple teams in the league who have been better than us after the all-star break in the past couple years,'' skiles said. ``we know we have to do that again this year. this was a great way to start it.''   phoenix, which won for the third time in four games, had a 51-32 rebounding edge and forced 21 turnovers.   ``we felt really good coming out of the break and we wanted to come out and take it to them,'' hardaway said. ``we played a complete game, and that's what we have to do. no one is giving us a chance, so we have to prove them wrong. it would be a wasted season if we (kept) playing the way we did in the first half.''   the loss was even tougher for pistons center cliff robinson, who was traded from phoenix to the pistons in the offseason. robinson, who had 27 points in a suns' 33-point rout in detroit last season, had four points and seven turnovers for his new team tuesday.   ``i didn't sit at home last night and say that my whole season depended onwinning this game, but it would have been nice to beat them,'' robinson said. notes  the pistons made two roster moves -- activating rookies ratko varda  and rodney white  and placing brian cardinal  (knee) and victor alexander  (back) on the injured list. varda made his nba debut in the fourth quarter, scoring five points. ... phoenix beat the pistons 106-73 in their previous visit to thepalace.   email this story  - (view most popular)

ap photo more photos     by john nadel ap sports writer  february 13, 2002       los angeles (ap) -- michael jordan  and the washington wizards  controlled the game for about 32 minutes.   then, it was like somebody flicked a switch, and the two-time defending nba champion los angeles lakers  came alive.   kobe bryant  scored 18 of his 23 points in the second half and had 11 rebounds and a career-high 15 assists for his third nba triple-double tuesday night as the lakers rallied from a 20-point deficit to beat the wizards 103-94.   thus, phil jackson was a winner in his first game coaching against jordan even though the lakers played without shaquille o'neal , sidelined due to pain in his arthritic right big toe.   ``it's a learning experience, and i think we learned a lot against a team that's probably still a championship-quality team, even without shaq,'' said jordan, who had 22 points, five rebounds and six assists. ``we just lost our composure, and i'm a part of that.   ``defensively, phil took options out of our game. they kind of mixed it up with the zones and man-to-man. if anyone knows my game, phil knows my game. and he has the right caliber of players to illustrate his coaching philosophies.''   jackson coached the jordan-led chicago bulls  to six championships in an eight-year span before both left that team in 1998. jackson took a year off before becoming coach of the lakers, and jordan ended his retirement this season.   ``he vowed he'd never play for another coach again, and there he was, playing against phil,'' lakers guard derek fisher  said of jordan. ``i'm sure it was a little difficult for him early on, but he was still able to put together a great game.''   but not great enough.   the lakers outscored the wizards 43-11 to turn a 63-43 deficit with 7:50 left in the third quarter into an 86-74 lead with 8:03 remaining in the game.   the wizards, who had their five-game winning streak snapped, got no closer than seven after that.   ``i did not know what happened in the first half, we kind of stumbled around,'' jackson said. ``i guess desperation is the answer.''   bryant shot 9-of-20 and, just as he promised, got his teammates involved -- especially in the third period.   and when it came time to score, he scored.   with a little over a minute left and the lakers leading 97-89, bryant hit from outside over jordan, drawing one of the loudest cheers of the night from the staples center crowd of 18,997.   jordan left the game for good a few seconds later.   bryant broke into a big smile afterward when asked about the fan reaction.   ``it made me feel good to come back to staples center and hear the crowd supporting you,'' he said.   two days earlier, he was booed loudly in his hometown of philadelphia during his mvp performance at the all-star game.   ap photo
ap photo more photos     by paul nowell associated press writer  february 14, 2002       charlotte, n.c. (ap) -- muggsy bogues  is leading a group that is trying to stop the charlotte hornets  from moving to new orleans.   bogues, a 5-foot-3 point guard who played for the hornets when they led the league in attendance in the late 1980s and early 1990s, will co-chair a hastily formed group that calls itself the ``let's take back the game'' committee.   ``it's great to see all these folks stepping up to the plate to try to save the franchise,'' bogues said wednesday. ``charlotte deserves an nba team.''   hanging over his head at a news conference was a sign that read ``new owners,'' something the group hopes to find. nevertheless, committee co-chair mac everett, a banker with wachovia corp., wouldn't discuss who those new owners might be.   ``the current owners of the hornets have stated their intentions very clearly that they want to move the team to new orleans,'' everett said. ``our intention is to keep the team in charlotte with new owners.   ``we now are not sure when a potential ownership group can be announced.''   everett said the committee will turn to the nba for advice on what needs to be done to save the franchise. immediate plans call for securing deposits for luxury suites and season tickets in a new downtown sports arena, he said.   bogues, one of the original hornets when the team joined the league in 1988, said he wants to recapture the spirit of that time when the charlotte coliseum was sold out every night.   ``this is basketball country,'' he said. ``i know the fans don't want the hornets to leave charlotte. the owners say they can't be successful here. but i don't believe the nba wants to up and leave charlotte.''   bogues, a guard for the dallas mavericks , though not on the team's active roster, didn't say anything at the news conference about buying a part of the club.   hornets owners george shinn and ray wooldridge have said the club is not for sale, and they plan to move to new orleans as soon as next season.   an nba official criticized the charlotte city council's latest effort to keep the hornets in town by requiring the team to change owners in order to get a new arena.   nba deputy commissioner russ granik suggested that forcing out wooldridge and shinn could only serve to alienate other potential owners.   ``i don't know what those people are trying to accomplish,'' granik said. ``it doesn't look like anything is happening there that is likely to keep the team in charlotte.   ``to come out and announce they'll build an arena only if there's new ownership, i don't see how that helps with the board of governors.''   that board -- with one vote for each of the 29 nba teams -- will decide in april whether to grant the hornets permission to move to new orleans.   several nba officials, including granik, have said charlotte needs an alternative ownership group available if the league rejects the hornets' request and shinn and wooldridge choose to sell.   but he said an ultimatum -- new owners or no arena -- won't work with the league. he added that charlotte's approach might make it pointless to address other issues, such as the outline of an arena lease.   email this story  - (view most popular)

(ap) -- add two more injuries and another blowout loss to what has been a frustrating season for the chicago bulls .   lee nailon  scored 24 points, baron davis  had 18 points and 12 assists and jamaal magloire  added 17 points and 10 rebounds as the charlotte hornets  beat chicago 113-91 wednesday night.   the bulls played the second half without starters eddie robinson  and brad miller . robinson scored 14 points in the first half before straining his groin. miller bruised his left calf.   ``brad is day to day, and with eddie it may be a while before we get him back,'' bulls coach bill cartwright said.   chicago was already without injured players ron mercer , charles oakley  and greg anthony .   ``we hadn't been playing like that lately, but you can only use a four-letter word to describe how we played,'' said ron artest , who had 10 points on 4-of-12 shooting. ``i was so frustrated out there because i wanted to do more.''   a.j. guyton  scored 19 points to lead chicago, which fell to 3-23 on the road.   the hornets shot 55 percent for the game and outrebounded the bulls 48-40.   ``it wasn't a perfect game, but for the most part we played very well,'' said hornets center elden campbell , who blocked six shots. ``we want to establish a low-post presence.''   leading 43-37, the hornets went on an 18-4 run to take a 20-point lead before settling for a 61-43 cushion at halftime. stacey augmon  scored eight points for the hornets, and the bulls committed four turnovers during the spurt.   without robinson and miller in the second half, the hornets pulled away. robert traylor 's alley-oop dunk from davis at the buzzer gave charlotte a 93-60 lead after three quarters.   the lead ballooned to as many as 40 in the final period as the hornets improved to 3-0 against the bulls this season and 10-2 in the past 12 meetings since 1998.   everyone got involved and it all worked out,'' cartwright said of the hornets. ``we didn't establish ourselves defensively and we didn't share the ball. i won't call it being selfish, but guys were trying to do too much.''   charlotte led 32-28 after the first quarter, which included a technical foul on the bulls for having six players on the floor.   artest appeared to be unsure if he was supposed to be in the game, then tried to casually walk off the court as the hornets screamed at the officials. nailon hit the technical free throw.   ``we have to find a way to keep this going,'' hornets coach paul silas said. ``our home court record (10-14) has been dismal so far. if we can get on a roll notes  silas said they'll likely stick with 11 players on the roster until jamal mashburn  returns monday from an abdominal injury. the hornets placed reserve matt bullard  on the injured list wednesday with back spasms. silas said he's resisting bringing back mashburn earlier. ``we're doing it by the book,'' silas said. ... cartwright said he's received e-mails from bulls owner jerry reinsdorf saying he's doing a good job, but having the interim tag removed from his title hasn't been mentioned. ``i'm not concerned about that,'' cartwright said.   email this story  - (view most popular)

(ap) -- while jason richardson  was establishing himself as a future star, his golden state warriors  teammates used the all-star break to get away from basketball for a few days.   richardson recorded his first career double-double with 19 points and 10 rebounds as the warriors defeated the boston celtics  92-75 wednesday night.   golden state lost its first eight games after last year's all-star game and finished the year winning just twice in 34 outings.   ``i guess the break was a great time for us to just get away and concentrate on things we need to do the rest of the season,'' said richardson, who won the slam dunk contest and was the mvp of the rookie challenge game. ``guys came back, had a great attitude and were focused. the break gave me a lot of confidence and i want to ride this as long as i can.''   the celtics were the perfect opponents for golden state, which snapped a five-game losing streak by beating boston for the sixth straight time at home.   antawn jamison  scored 27 points as the warriors turned in their best second-half defensive effort of the season, allowing just 28 points as the celtics shot just 18 percent (7-of-39) from the field.   ``everybody took it upon themselves to step it up defensively,'' jamison said.   the 75 points were the second lowest of the season for boston, and the second lowest allowed by the warriors.   ``they didn't shoot the ball well, but i think our defense had something to do with that,'' said bobby sura, who finished with 11 points.   paul pierce  scored 30 points for boston, the 20th time this season he reached that level. only philadelphia's allen iverson  (21 times) has done it more often.   antoine walker  followed his first triple-double of the season tuesday night in denver with 13 points and 12 rebounds.   ``we just didn't make the shots down the stretch, and we usually can make shots in the fourth quarter,'' said walker, who missed his final five shots. ``we had shots, but they just didn't fall.''   the warriors won despite making less than 40 percent of their shots for the 17th time this season. boston was even worse, making just 31 percent of its shots one night after shooting 53 percent in a victory over denver.   ``we had opportunities,'' said pierce, who also had 11 rebounds. ``we got what we wanted on offense, but didn't knock them down.''   the celtics missed eight of their first nine shots in the fourth quarter as golden state built a 79-69 edge with five minutes to play.   the warriors eventually led by as many as 20 points as boston made just two of 19 shots and scored 11 points in the final period.   the celtics took a 58-54 lead with 7:59 left in the third quarter on a jumper by pierce.   golden state then went on a 17-6 run to take a 71-64 advantage into the final period.   in the first half, the warriors had a 12-point lead when richardson hit a 3-pointer with 5:02 left. boston went on a 17-8 run the rest of the way toclose to 50-47 at halftime. notes  richardson received a standing ovation when he was honored before the game for his all-star accomplishments. ... boston's last win in oakland was 116-115 on feb. 15, 1995. ... warriors c marc jackson , eligible to play after a two-game team suspension, has a strained left calf and did not play for the 12th straight game. ... the six-game home winning streak over the celtics isgolden state's longest against any nba team.   email this story  - (view most popular)
ap photo more photos  boston was in first place in the al east on june 27, when martinez went on the disabled list. the red sox were in contention when he returned aug. 26, but he was not the same pitcher who was 7-1 with a 1.44 era on memorial day.   the red sox were just 17-26 in their last 43 games, and martinez made his last start sept. 7, lasting three innings against the new york yankees .   he announced sept. 18 that he wouldn't pitch again because of shoulder inflammation, ending his season at 7-3 with a 2.39 era.   before then, boston general manager dan duquette said martinez might be healthy enough to pitch, a statement that upset his ace.   ``we had a meeting. he apologized,'' martinez said. ``we get along really well. dan has always been a nice person to me and a good gm. i respect him a lot.''   duquette may lose his job once the sale of the red sox to a group headed by john henry is finalized. martinez figures to be around much longer.   ``my pitches are there, especially the fastball,'' he said. ``i'm looking forward to putting up more numbers and maintain my level, not be just one more player on the pile.''   email this story  - (view most popular)
ap photo more photos     by howard ulman ap sports writer  february 14, 2002       fort myers, fla. (ap) -- pedro martinez  was a strange sight in the boston red sox  clubhouse thursday -- more muscular and, for a change, an early arrival at spring training.   then he took the field and looked like the same old pedro. he threw smoothly and showed no sign of the worst injury of his brilliant career.   ``i haven't gassed it up yet, but i've been feeling really good,'' martinez said.   credit an offseason program in his native dominican republic in which he lifted weights regularly for the first time. he said he took just seven days off and spent so much time in the gym that he sometimes didn't get to his boat, where he listened to music, until 10 p.m.   attribute it to the empty feeling he felt when a shoulder injury limited him to career lows of 18 games and seven wins last season, none in the last four months.   whatever the reason, the three-time cy young award winner is serious about resuming his status as baseball's best pitcher.   ``he's done everything he could in the offseason to set himself up for a good season, to set himself up for 32, 33 starts,'' manager joe kerrigan said. ``he looks a lot stronger than at any point that i've seen him in the last 10 years.''   standing bare-chested by his locker the day before pitchers and catchers were due to report, the difference in the 30-year-old martinez was obvious thursday.   his chest was beefier, his biceps more defined. he hopes the extra strength and conditioning will keep him off the disabled list for the first time in four seasons.   ``we're on the same workout program, huh?'' 6-foot-6 derek lowe  said as he passed by, hoping his own bulked-up physique will ease his transition from reliever to starter.   martinez is only 5-foot-11 but he reported at about 190 pounds, 12 pounds heavier.   ``when i saw my arms getting so big i was like, ``wow, it looks good,' '' he said with a smile. ``but i don't know, is it going to be heavier to bring it up to throw the curveball?''   martinez also gained weight before last year's spring training but lost much of it. he didn't feel comfortable at any time last season.   ``i'm not a small man anymore,'' he said. ``hopefully, i'll keep most of the weight.''   he's already played long toss twice after arriving tuesday and plans to pitch from a mound saturday at the team's first workout. he missed the opening practice the last two years when he spent extra time back home.   ``i gave the team my word that i was going to be in early, that i was going to let them check everything that i was doing,'' martinez said. ``i wanted to come here being healthy.''   he also avoided past whispers that he was setting a poor example by arriving after the voluntary reporting date.   ``that's very important, especially for the young guys. it's going to make everybody work harder,'' first baseman brian daubach  said.   the red sox struggled last season after injuries tot martinez, shortstop nomar garciaparra  and catcher jason varitek .   ap photo
ap photo more photos     by steven wine ap sports writer  february 14, 2002       miami (ap) -- as jeff torborg tried on his new florida marlins  jersey thursday, he looked out at a room filled with reporters and cameramen for his introductory news conference.   ``this is larger than the crowds we had in montreal last year,'' torborg joked.   small crowds will likely continue to be the norm in florida, too -- at least until the marlins start winning, which their new manager expects to happen soon.   ``i come into this job feeling this ballclub has a chance to be a very good team,'' torborg said. ``i think it will be an interesting race in this division.''   torborg believes the marlins can contend with the atlanta braves  and new york mets  in the nl east, even though both teams were active during the offseason while the marlins stood pat, awaiting the sale of the franchise to expos owner jeffrey loria.   major league owners approved the deal tuesday, and one of loria's first moves was to make official the long-anticipated hiring of torborg. the new manager and a new coaching staff will be in melbourne on friday when pitchers and catchers begin to report for spring training. the first workout is sunday.   ``we're going to be on the field in three days, which gives us plenty of time to get ready,'' new general manager larry beinfest joked, stressing the word ``plenty.''   when workouts begin, beinfest and torborg expect to like what they see. torborg managed the expos the final four months of last season and regarded the marlins even then as potential playoff contenders. they finished a disappointing 76-86, 12 games behind the first-place braves.   but the more torborg learns, the more he likes the young team he inherited.   ``this was a fun team to watch. i'm not saying it was a fun team to play against,'' torborg said. ``when i started doing a little research about the club, i got so many nice comments about what great chemistry this team has. everybody i spoke to -- major league scouts and people in all parts of this game -- said this is a special group of kids.''   torborg, 60, has a losing record (539-613) in nine seasons with four teams, but he could be a good fit for florida because of his reputation for handling young players well. the chicago white sox  were baseball's youngest team when he led them to a 94-win season in 1990.   after being fired by the mets 38 games into the 1993 season, torborg became a network radio broadcaster. he returned to the dugout last may 31 when loria hired him to replace felipe alou as the expos' manager.   loria and torborg met in 1982, when a mutual acquaintance -- yankees owner george steinbrenner -- asked torborg to help loria's nephew, a teen-ager pitcher. with torborg's tutoring, the youngster threw three no-hitters in high school, and loria and torborg have been friends since.   ``we've know each other for a long time, and we just shoot the breeze about baseball,'' torborg said. ``he's got a passion for the game. he loves the players.''   the same goes for torborg. he has been tinkering with potential batting orders -- including one that has cleanup hitter preston wilson  batting no. 2 -- but said the marlins' lineup and rotation are virtually set.   ``the only thing we've got to do is tweak the bench and bullpen a little bit,'' torborg said.   that's barring any trades to reduce the payroll. beinfest, heading into his first season as a general manager, declined to discuss the projected payroll but said he'll be in the market to make deals that improve the team.   ``no one is untouchable,'' beinfest said. ``some guys are less likely to be traded than others.''   when that comment was relayed to torborg, he feigned displeasure.   ``larry, we've got to talk,'' torborg joked. ``they're all untouchable to me.''   email this story  - (view most popular)

(ap) -- michael jordan  knows champions, and he likes what he sees of the sacramento kings .   ``i think they have the talent by far,'' jordan said after the kings defeated his washington wizards  109-93 thursday night. ``it's all about mental capacity and mental toughness to overcome a mountain they seem not to have done the past couple of years. based on what i saw, they certainly have the opportunity to win this year.''   especially when the kings are playing at home, where they're 28-1 this season.   chris webber , who's boycotting the media because of an article regarding his personal life, had 20 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists as the kings won their 20th straight at home.   sacramento is within three wins of the franchise record for consecutive home victories set by the rochester royals in 1949-50.   peja stojakovic added 21 points and mike bibby  scored 20 as sacramento improved its league-best record to 39-12. bobby jackson  added 14 points.   ``payback was on our minds,'' jackson said. ``we don't lose here on our home court, so we just had to jump on them. whoever was guarding michael jordan did a nice job. he wasn't making as many shots as he was last time.''   the kings, who won their second straight since a 108-101 loss in washington last week, have not lost to the same team twice this season.   ``we felt we didn't play very well there and we wanted to make a little bit of a statement that we're a much better team than that,'' sacramento coach rick adelman said. ``our guys responded.''   jordan, a six-time nba champion playing his first game in sacramento in more than four years, was held to 16 points as the wizards lost their second straight after winning their previous five. richard hamilton  added 20 points and christian laettner  had 14 points and 11 rebounds in his second game back from a bruised right thigh.   ``they got 12 points off turnovers and steals in the second quarter and we paid for that,'' washington coach doug collins said. ``the lakers and sacramento are the cream of the crop in the west, and we'll have to play in those kinds of environments if we make the playoffs.''   webber, who missed his first triple-double of the season by one assist, recorded his 15th double-double in 26 starts. he has scored more than 20 points in 18 of his last 19 games.   the kings shot 14-for-27 and scored 36 points in the third quarter, matching a season high for the period. sacramento led by as many as 26 points in the period and held an 83-59 lead after three quarters.   ``they controlled the tempo,'' jordan said.   sacramento, after trailing 13-4, turned things around in the final 7:38 of the first quarter, making seven of 11 shots and outscoring the wizards 17-5.   ``we beat them at our place, but i don't think we saw their best game,'' jordan said. ``they looked extremely good, and we're just not in their ballpark.''  sacramento led 47-36 at the half. notes  jordan played his 13th career game in sacramento. he has a record of 11-2 in the city. his previous loss was feb. 1, 1988. ... the kings sold out for the 110th consecutive time, the second-longest current streak behind the new york knicks . ... the wizards last swept a series from sacramento in the 1996-97 season. ... washington's jahidi white  had his fifth double-double of the season with 11 points and 10 rebounds. ... sacramento improved to 21-0 whenleading after the first quarter.   email this story  - (view most popular)

(ap) -- san diego padres  outfielder mike darr  was killed and a minor league pitcher was injured early friday when the vehicle they were riding in rolled over on a phoenix freeway.   another man in the vehicle -- 23-year-old duane johnson, of reno, nev. -- also was killed in the accident. authorities said he was a longtime friend of darr.   darr, 25, was san diego's opening-day center fielder in 2001, his first full big league season, and started 69 games.   ben howard, a 23-year-old pitcher who played for san diego's class-a and double-a affiliates last season, was treated at the scene and released, arizona department of public safety spokesman frank valenzuela said. the team said he sustained scrapes and bruises.   ``this is a very, very difficult thing to begin spring training with,'' padres manager bruce bochy said. ``it's such a tragic loss.''   bochy said darr ``was a fun-loving guy who played the game like it was supposed to be played. he played all-out and that's going to be missed.''   padres closer trevor hoffman  broke down and cried when talking about darr.   ``we've lost a special teammate, a special person,'' hoffman said. ``there are a lot of heavy hearts in the locker room. there's a lot of shock in the clubhouse right now. ... you don't want to believe it.   ``michael was a free spirit. he was a happy-go-lucky guy. he embraced life. he embraced everybody in a special way. he always had a smile that lit up the clubhouse.''   last year, darr made 24 starts in center field and 45 in right, where tony gwynn  hardly played because of leg injuries. darr moved into the starting lineup after ruben rivera  was released in spring training but eventually gave way to mark kotsay , who was obtained from florida just before opening day.   darr was good defensively but didn't have much power, hitting just two homers last year. however, both were game-winners in the padres' last at-bat. he batted .277 with 34 rbis.   darr was the padres' minor league player of the year in 1997 after being obtained from detroit with another player for second baseman jody reed late in spring training.   in 2000, darr shared the padres' minor league player of the year award with jeremy owens. darr hit .344 with 9 homers and 65 rbis in 91 games with triple-a las vegas.   he was recalled to the padres on july 31. in his first game following the recall he hit the second pitch he saw for a two-run homer against philadelphia. darr also played in five games for san diego in mid-april 2000 before returning to triple-a.   the crash occurred about 2 a.m. mst. friday was the voluntary reporting date for pitchers and catchers.   darr became the second player in the padres organization to be killed in a car crash in less than year.   on july 29, minor league pitcher gerik baxter was killed near indio, calif., when a rear tire on his pickup blew out, causing the truck to swerve into another car and roll several times. oakland athletics  draft pick mark hilde, a passenger in the truck, also died.   ``this organization, we've been through this before,'' padres general manager kevin towers said. ``more than anything, it's about family.''   valenzuela said darr was driving and it appeared the accident was alcohol related.   ``we all realize that drinking and driving is not a good mix,'' towers said. ``we're not sure of all the details yet, but that is certainly something that we don't condone.''   the vehicle apparently drifted into the dirt center median, then the driver overcorrected, valenzuela said.   it rolled across three lanes of the freeway and crashed through a fence, coming to rest on a frontage road.   valenzuela said darr and johnson were not wearing seat belts and were ejected while howard was in the back seat and was wearing a seat belt.   howard, a right-hander who was a second-round pick in the 1997 amateur draft, was 8-2 with a 2.83 era with class a lake elsinore and 2-0 with a 2.40 era at aa mobile.   he was selected to the california league all-star team while with lake elsinore.   towers said howard was shaken up by the accident.   ``he was conscious throughout everything and he saw it all,'' towers said. ``i'm sure psychologically, it's going to be difficult for him.''   darr is survived by his wife, natalie, and two sons, mike jr. and matthew.   email this story  - (view most popular)

(ap) -- dan duquette said friday he expects to remain general manager of the boston red sox  after the team's new owners take over.   the purchasing group, headed by john henry, has kept its plans for duquette private although there have been reports it is seeking alternatives. baseball owners have approved the sale from the jean r. yawkey trust, and duquette said the closing will be march 1.   he has upset his own players and officials from other teams with an aloof attitude and personnel decisions such as the firing last year of bullpen coach john cumberland.   but duquette did have a good offseason. he acquired pitchers john burkett , dustin hermanson  and darren oliver , first baseman tony clark  and outfielders johnny damon  and rickey henderson  while unloading troublesome outfielder carl everett .   when asked friday at his first spring training appearance if he had the same parking spot at the red sox spring training facility, duquette laughed.   ``we're here,'' he said before changing the subject. ``i think the fans are going to like the team. you know, whenever you start spring training all over again, it's a sign of spring. the boys are back in town.''   dressed in a brown leather sport coat and sitting on a bench in the shade outside the red sox clubhouse, duquette spent the first 1 minute, 50 seconds of his meeting with reporters discussing the stability of the pitching staff and the lineup and making no mention of his future.   the first question, of course, concerned his future.   asked if he had talked with the new owners, he said he had and added that ``they're going to be a big asset to boston.''   the next four questions came in a rapid-fire manner.   did they spell out his role?   ``i'm the general manager. we're in spring training and i'm here. i'm the gm and i'm looking forward to the season,'' he said.   does he expect to be the general manager after the closing?   ``i'm looking forward to doing my job with the red sox and helping the red sox achieve their ultimate goal of a world series championship.''   the question was repeated: does he expect to remain general manager?   ``uh, yes, i do.''   have the new owners spelled out to him that he's their guy?   he laughed and said, ``those are questions that you ought to put toward them, but i'm looking forward to having a good season here with the red sox.''   duquette is entering his ninth season as red sox general manager. they reached the playoffs four times in that span but never made it to the world series.   ap photo

ap photo more photos     by john nadel ap sports writer  february 16, 2002       los angeles (ap) -- the los angeles lakers  have fallen into a pattern the last two months -- beat the strong opponents, and lose to the weak ones.   they lost to another weak one friday night.   shareef abdur-rahim  scored 12 of his 32 points in the fourth quarter as the atlanta hawks  held off the two-time defending nba champions 93-90.   atlanta (18-33) joined memphis (14-37), golden state (15-33), denver (16-32), miami (20-29) and chicago (12-38) as teams that have beaten the lakers since dec. 21.   the bulls, with the league's worst record, accomplished the feat twice -- once at staples center -- and the wins by denver, miami and now atlanta also came on the lakers' home court, where they've won 19 of 25 games.   despite the setbacks, the lakers (35-14) have the nba's second-best record.   ``the first two quarters or three quarters, we just didn't play hard, and there's no excuse for that,'' said kobe bryant , who led the lakers with 21 points and 10 assists despite being held scoreless for the first 18 minutes. ``we didn't match their intensity.   ``we should be the aggressors, and we weren't tonight.''   the hawks went ahead for good early in the second quarter, and dion glover 's dunk with 1:56 left in the third period capped a 21-9 run and made it 69-50 lead, prompting boos from the capacity crowd of 18,997.   ``i think that's frustration on their part,'' lakers forward robert horry  said of the fans' reaction. ``i don't blame them.''   atlanta, just 6-21 on the road, led 70-55 entering the fourth quarter, and ira newble 's two free throws with 5:57 remaining made it 83-68.   that's when the lakers began their comeback, but it fell short.   ``they played better than we did tonight,'' lakers coach phil jackson said. ``they got to loose balls, and they created situations for themselves. their interior game swamped us inside.''   by winning for the fourth time in five games after losing 12 of 13, the hawks avenged a 127-93 loss to the lakers in atlanta on jan. 29.   ``i think our guys felt really bad about that,'' hawks coach lon krueger said. ``they were really overwhelmed in all facets of the game. they responded in an appropriate way.   ``we were awfully solid and consistent for 44 minutes. it got a little frantic at the end. you expect the world champions to make a run.''   abdur-rahim made two free throws with 3:20 left to make it 87-77, but the lakers got 3-pointers from derek fisher  and devean george  as part of a 9-2 run to draw within three points with 1:49 remaining.   george and horry both missed 3-pointers that could have tied the game before atlanta's dermarr johnson  made two free throws with 29.5 seconds to play, making it 91-86.   george made a 3-pointer 4 seconds later to make it a two-point game. the hawks then ran the clock down before abdur-rahim was fouled and made two clinching free throws with 5.3 seconds left. horry's foul shot with 3 seconds remaining completed the scoring.   ap photo
ap photo more photos       february 16, 2002       clearwater, fla. (ap) -- scott rolen  won't commit to the philadelphia phillies  until the team makes a bigger commitment to winning.   rolen arrived at spring training saturday with his explanation for rejecting a $140 million, 10-year contract extension and criticism of team president.   ``personally, i'm tired of the excuses, of the promises that aren't there,'' rolen said. ``i was asked to commit for the rest of my career, with the promise of a commitment two years from now, with the new stadium. that is not right to me.   ``i think the fans of philadelphia deserve better than what they've gotten over the last 15 years. i feel bad about that. so $140 million is not the issue here. in my mind, (turning down) $140 million makes me feel bad, but i can't get over the principle of giving everything i have without any reciprocation from ownership.''   the phillies are coming off their first winning season since 1993 and finished just two games behind nl east champion atlanta in 2001.   but while the rival mets and braves were making big moves this offseason, the phillies' did little. their payroll remains in the bottom half at about $60 million this season.   ``philadelphia is the sixth-largest market in the game, and i feel that for the last however long, the organization has not acted like it,'' rolen said. ``there's a lack of commitment to what i think is right. i'm not seeing that their no. 1 goal is to put a winning team on the field. that's my no. 1 goal, and that's why i put on a uniform every day.''   rolen, who will turn 27 on april 4, has averaged 26 homers and 95 rbis over his first five full seasons in the majors. last year, he hit .289 with 25 homers and 107 rbis in 151 games, while winning his second gold glove.   the phillies tried to offer rolen an extension last march, but negotiations broke down when the club wouldn't agree to a clause in the contract tied to payroll. in november, after a season in which rolen was publicly criticized by manager larry bowa and special general manager assistant dallas green, the phillies offered $140 million again and again were turned down.   general manager ed wade and team president david montgomery disputed rolen's criticisms of their offseason moves.   ``i guess i feel a lot better about our club than maybe he does at this point,'' wade said. ``we increased the payroll 25 percent. we didn't go into this offseason as a number of clubs did and say, 'we got to cut payroll back, we gotta stay status quo.'''   montgomery says he's tried to convince rolen that the franchise is in the beginning of a growth period and that the payroll will significantly increase when the club opens its new ballpark in 2004.   ``the one part of what scott said that i agree with is his statement that he's an idiot for not signing with us,'' montgomery said. ``i strongly disagree with his assessment of our club. at this point, we have clearly not been successful in getting him comfortable with our vision about the club.''   despite rolen's views, wade remains hopeful the sides eventually can agree on a new contract. he's also on record as saying rolen no longer is an untouchable.   when negotiations went nowhere last fall, wade unsuccessfully tried to trade rolen. if the phillies aren't in playoff contention by this summer's trade deadline, trade rumors will heat up again.   ``if we're going to have the type of season that we plan on having, then we're not going to be looking to trading scott rolen on july 31,'' wade said.   if rolen lasts the season and ownership convinces him of a long-term commitment to winning, he's not completely shutting the door on spending the rest of his career in philadelphia.   ``i didn't say my options weren't going to be open at free-agent time,'' rolen said. ``but right now, i look at it and i see the ownership asking me to make a commitment, and i don't see the ownership reciprocating the commitment i make on the field.''   email this story  - (view most popular)

(ap) -- even after its fourth victory over a top 25 team this season, rutgers isn't quite ready to start touting its chances for an ncaa tournament berth.   the scarlet knights snapped a five-game losing streak to miami with a 64-61 victory sunday, improving their chances to reach the tournament for the first time since 1991.   but they know they still have games to win.   ``it is hard not to put it (an ncaa berth) first, but you have to realize we could easily lose the rest of our games,'' said freshman ricky shields, who had 17 points and five assists.   the scarlet knights know they must win on the road and in the big east tournament to reach the ncaas. they are 14-1 at home, but finish with three of four games on the road.   ``it's all day-by-day,'' said jerome coleman, who scored a career-high 30 points for rutgers.   it was the third straight game against a ranked team that coleman established a career high. the junior guard had 26 against then-no. 17 connecticut and 27 against then-no.24 syracuse. he is averaging 21.7 in seven games against ranked foes and 16.7 points overall.   the 13th-ranked hurricanes, on the other hand, know they will be in the ncaa tournament, but forward darius rice thinks miami needs to sharpen its edge before the postseason.   ``i think our team chemistry has to get better,'' said rice, who had 21 points, but missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer at the buzzer against rutgers. ``we need to come together as a team and say 'we're going to play like the no. 13 team in the country.'''   miami (21-5, 8-5 big east) committed a season-high 21 turnovers against rutgers (17-8, 7-5) and point guard john salmons had a career-high nine turnovers. the hurricanes' halfcourt offense couldn't get the ball inside to elton tyler, who had just four points.   ``i don't think we're scuffling, i think we're playing really good teams,'' said miami coach perry clark, whose team is 3-3 in its last six.   miami, which never led in the second half, nearly went into overtime, but rice's 3-point attempt went off the back iron as time expired.   ``when i let it go, it was lined up,'' rice said. ``it just was a little too long. i have confidence in all my shots and i thought it would drop and send us into overtime. i guess it was just their night.''   rutgers led just 42-39 with 13:41 remaining, but took control when miami missed 12 of its next 14 shots.   ``they just pressured the ball and made perimeter players make perimeter plays,'' said salmons, who had 14 points, seven assists and six rebounds. ``they had tremendous pressure on the ball, and we turned it over.''   rutgers built a 61-52 lead during miami's cold streak as coleman hit three 3-pointers in a 19-13 run.   james jones' basket closed miami to 61-57 with 25.7 seconds remaining. coleman followed with two free throws, but salmons answered with a driving layup, and coleman made one of two from the line to give rutgers a 64-59 lead with 17.5 seconds left.   rice then scored on a drive, and rutgers turned it over on the inbounds pass to set up the hurricanes' final attempt.   rutgers' rashod kent, who had nine points and 16 rebounds, had to leave after the game because his mother, brenda, who came up from west virginia to watch the game, was taken to nearby st. peter's medical center late in the game. her condition was unknown.   email this story  - (view most popular)
ap photo more photos     by mel reisner ap sports writer  february 18, 2002       phoenix (ap) -- scott skiles, who inherited a team in disarray when he succeeded danny ainge as coach of the phoenix suns , left them in much the same condition.   former assistant frank johnson ran the team sunday night, but couldn't keep the dallas mavericks  from handing the suns their third straight loss, 105-92. phoenix is 25-27, in 10th place in the western conference and in danger of sitting out the nba playoffs for the first time since 1988.   skiles and suns management called the parting amicable, but team chairman jerry colangelo left little doubt he wanted a change.   ``we have underachieved,'' colangelo said. ``you take a step at a time. the one thing i will tell you is that this step is the next logical step. frank now has an opportunity to take this group of people and see what he can do with them. the commitment is there to do whatever is necessary to keep moving forward with our franchise.   ``if it means adding, if it means starting over, if it means somewhere between, we'll do whatever it takes to be as competitive as we can and extract as much as we can out of the talent that we have.''   the 43-year-old johnson, the first black head coach in franchise history, thinks a change of attitude is needed, not an overhaul.   ``we have to come together as a team,'' johnson said. ``it's going to take some time, but i am looking forward to the task.''   johnson joined the suns on nov. 5, 1992, when he signed as a reserve guard on a team that featured charles barkley at forward and dan majerle  and kevin johnson in the backcourt and reached the nba finals.   he played two seasons, then became an assistant coach on feb. 20, 1997. he was skiles' top assistant the last two seasons.   skiles, the nba's second-youngest coach at 37, said he and team president bryan colangelo reached a mutual agreement to part ways during a meeting saturday morning.   ``we just sat down like two friends and two men and discussed the state of the team, and both of us came to the same idea,'' skiles said.   he said he plans to relax for a few days, but expects to return to coaching.   ``i think i'm a pro coach, but why rule anything out,'' he said of potential major college offers.   skiles got his first nba head coaching job when ainge resigned to spend more time with his family 20 games into the 1999-00 season. skiles finished that season 40-22 and led the suns to a 51-31 mark last season.   they reached the conference semifinals for the first time in five years by beating san antonio in a first-round series in 2000.   there were reports of friction between the coach and players like penny hardaway, who was skiles' teammate with the orlando magic . hardaway declined to comment on the move.   ``it's not for me to say whether it's right or wrong,'' he said. ``as players, we just have to go out and compete every single night. if management wants to make a decision on something, there's nothing that we can do about it.''   tom gugliotta , another former skiles teammate with the washington bullets , was stung by the news.   ``it leaves a bad taste in your mouth, but it's frank's opportunity now,'' gugliotta said. ``he's got a lot of respect from all the players, and we've got to straight it out. it's up to the guys in this locker room to fix it. by no means was it all scott's fault.''   johnson met with the players sunday morning and discussed the transition.   the suns once were a hallmark of stability, but now are on their fourth coach in six years, something colangelo acknowledged might be a trend.   ``maybe it's a sign of the times,'' he said. ``i don't think it's a matter of patience.''   email this story  - (view most popular)
ap photo more photos     by andres ybarra associated press writer  february 18, 2002       minneapolis (ap) -- the minnesota timberwolves  repaired their psyche at the expense of the miami heat .   with their next four games on the road -- including tuesday at dallas and sunday at san antonio -- the wolves wanted some momentum for the final race to the postseason.   the timberwolves got the boost they needed, defeating the heat 93-80 sunday, two days after blowing a 14-point lead in a loss to denver.   ``a win's a win, but to win a game this way helps our confidence,'' said chauncey billups , who had 23 points and eight assists.   the timberwolves put miami away early with the help of balanced scoring spurts and a zone defense. with kevin garnett  pressuring the point and joe smith  and rasho nesterovic playing inside, the heat were forced into long-range jumpers.   ``we were on the same page today,'' wally szczerbiak  said. ``on friday, denver hit their open shots in the third and fourth quarter. today, miami had open looks, but just didn't knock them down. our zone did a good job of making them take contested outside shots.''   added heat coach pat riley, ``when you have a 7-footer at the point and two under the basket, it makes it difficult to attack.''   riley was visibly frustrated with his team's performance. after recovering from a 6-23 start, the heat pushed their record to 20-29 before sunday's game, provoking talk of a possible dash for the eighth seed in the eastern conference.   but they looked like the miami of earlier in the season, shooting 32-for-80 from the field and 9-of-14 from the free-throw line.   ``we've won 12 of 15 and we think we're an .800 team,'' riley said. ``we're a .400 team and our guys don't see that.''   the heat finished the game on a 12-4 run, but the lead the wolves built wasn't in any real danger.   ``miami plays very physical. we knew we were going to have to push the ball down their throats,'' billups said.   minnesota hit seven of its first eight shots and jumped to a 14-4 lead.   when eddie house  hit a running jumper to pull the heat to 30-22 with 9:55 left in the second quarter, it was the closest they would get.   ``they were ready from the get-go. our guys weren't ready at all,'' riley said.   szczerbiak, who had 22 points, and billups combined for 15 during a 20-14 run that minnesota used to close out the first half for a 50-36 lead.   after halftime, the wolves went on a 16-2 run to make it 66-43. billups capped the run after falling down and keeping his dribble. from the floor, he found a wide-open szczerbiak, who drained a short jumper.   two plays later, billups made another tough play as he drove the baseline, drew contact, and made the basket just as he was knocked to the ground.   ``this was a big game for us,'' coach flip saunders said. ``it was one wehad to have, and now we go on the road for four huge games.'' notes  miami's laphonso ellis  returned to minnesota for the first time since being picked up from the wolves as a free agent in august. ellis joked around with szczerbiak, billups and other timberwolves during pregame warmups. fans gave him a polite ovation when he first entered the game as a reserve. ... the wolves are only 2-3 against sub .500 teams in their last 12 games. ... garnett said he would formally announce a foundation on monday to help create businessopportunities for young people.   email this story  - (view most popular)
ap photo more photos  one stroke behind in the final round, mattiace hit two balls into the water on the island-green 17th and made an 8. his mother, joyce, was suffering from lung cancer and watched from a wheelchair. it was the last full round she saw him play. she died three months later.   asked how long it took him to recover, mattiace smiled and said, ``what year is this?''   ``it was really hard for about a month,'' he said. ``everybody saw that. they saw me with disasters.''   just look at him now.   mattiace can finally call himself a winner on the pga tour, claiming it on a course where two years ago kirk triplett  won for the first time in 266 starts.   the low-key mattiace mingled with the hollywood crowd during the week. he called actor chris o'donnell, a former partner during at the pebble beach national pro-am.   ``he said, 'dude, you're going to win this week.' but he says that every time i call,'' mattiace said.   there was no repeat of last year's six-man playoff, but it was close.   rory sabbatini  failed to get up-and-down for birdie on the 17th and tied for second, one stroke behind after a 68.   the real hard-luck case was brad faxon . one of the best putters in golf, he missed birdie putts of 8 and 12 feet down the stretch, then bent over and tugged at his hair as his 12-foot birdie putt on the 18th stopped a half-inch from falling.   he also had a 68 to finish one stroke behind.   for a guy who had never won, mattiace played with the poise of a winner.   despite making bogeys on two of his first five holes, mattiace stayed in contention with three straight birdies to start the back nine. the last one was the most unlikely. from a slight indentation in the sand, his bunker shot narrowly cleared the steep lip, and mattiace took a bow as the gallery erupted when the ball disappeared in the cup.   he gave it right back with a bunker shot that sailed some 50 feet over the flag, but that was the last mistake he made.   ``i didn't force anything,'' mattiace said. ``some pins were difficult. you either hit a great shot or you make bogey. i didn't want to do that. i just wanted to be right there and see what happens.''   he finally got a happy ending.   email this story  - (view most popular)
ap photo more photos     by doug ferguson ap golf writer  february 18, 2002       los angeles (ap) -- len mattiace  went through seven full pga tour seasons and 219 tournaments without winning. he knew better than to think too far ahead, to consider how sweet it would be to finally hold up a trophy.   he wasn't thinking ahead when he holed an improbable bunker shot on no. 12 for his third straight birdie to stay in contention. or when he came to the final hole tied for the lead with scott mccarron . not even when mccarron missed his 6-foot par putt.   ``strange things can happen,'' said mattiace, who has seen his share of them.   this time, they happened to everyone else.   mattiace, who has never finished higher than 61st on the money list and arrived at riviera as the 157th player in the world ranking, finally walked away a winner at the nissan open.   ``sometimes it feels like it's a long way away. other times, you feel like you can smell it, touch it,'' said mattiace, who closed with a 3-under 68 for a one-stroke victory. ``it's a better feeling than i thought it would be.''   it was a sick feeling for mccarron, who led by three shots with seven holes to play.   ``that was my tournament to win,'' he said sunday.   the former ucla golfer had the sunset boulevard crowd behind him. he had the lead. he was hitting the ball fine. it all fell apart on the greens, where mccarron missed 6-foot putts on the final three holes and finished with a 71.   his cell phone went off as he started to talk, and mccarron proved a gracious loser.   ``that's my mom,'' he said, looking at his phone. ``she still loves me.''   even his mother might have debated his decision on the 18th hole, although mccarron had no regrets -- and not many options.   trying to keep the nissan open from going to a playoff for the second straight year, mccarron's approach went at the flag, but a little long, stopping in the shaggy kikuya grass just beyond the fringe, above the hole.   ``if i hit sand wedge, i have no shot at stopping it,'' mccarron said. ``i could have hit 8-iron, but kikuya is so unpredictable with chipping.''   he chose his broom-handled putter. the ball caught a tuft of grass and bounced high, losing its speed quickly and veering to the left. his putt to force a playoff never had a chance.   mattiace collected himself and tapped in for a two-putt par, finishing at 269 and claiming the first-place check of $666,000.   ``i wouldn't wish that on anyone,'' mattiace said. ``you don't want to see anyone make a mistake like that.''   the 34-year-old from jacksonville, fla., had been there himself.   mattiace had a two-stroke lead at disney in 1997 going into the final round, but closed with a 74 to finish in a tie for third. his best chance to win -- and certainly the most memorable -- came at the players championship in 1998.   ap photo

(ap) -- ruben patterson  won bragging rights against kobe bryant  this time around.   patterson, who developed a rivalry with bryant while they were teammates in los angeles during the 1998-99 season, held the lakers' star to four points when he was guarding him in the portland trail blazers ' 111-105 victory sunday.   ``i take this personally,'' patterson said. ``it goes back to my rookie year with them. he started everything. every time we play the lakers, it's personal with me.''   patterson, who missed the first game between the teams this season while serving a suspension, had 22 points and eight rebounds. bryant finished with 28 points, but was held scoreless in the third quarter, missing all seven shots he took.   ``he's a good defensive player,'' bryant said. ``if we bump into each other in the gym, we'll play and i'll demolish him. five-on-five is another story. it's different with 5-on-5.''   bonzi wells  had 27 points and 10 rebounds, and rasheed wallace  added 25 points to help the blazers beat the lakers, who were without the injured shaquille o'neal  and had their five-game road winning streak snapped.   rick fox  had a season-high 18 points, and robert horry  added 22 points and eight rebounds for los angeles.   ``ruben patterson again was the nemesis of the lakers,'' los angeles coach phil jackson said. ``i think whoever gets to the finals should hire him immediately. he might be able to help anybody beat us.''   dale davis  had 12 points and 10 rebounds, and damon stoudamire  had a season-high 14 assists for the blazers.   ``i just tried to get everybody (involved),'' stoudamire said. ``with shaq not in there, it's obviously going to be easier to penetrate. the way the flow was going, i tried to push the ball and tried to keep the tempo the way i wanted.''   portland took an 89-87 lead with 6:54 left and never lost it thanks to a 11-4 run that gave the blazers a nine-point advantage, their largest.   portland went ahead 63-56 on the strength of a 9-0 run to open the second half. the lakers didn't score until 4:23 into the third.   ``it was a game of runs,'' portland coach maurice cheeks said. ``they make a run and then we'd come back and make one. this is certainly a satisfying win. it would have been disappointing to lose to them with shaq out.''   los angeles chipped away at the deficit for the remainder of the third, eventually pulling ahead 78-77 with 8.1 seconds left. the blazers scored with 1.9 left to regain the lead.   ``i thought we had a good game going there, then all of a sudden it disappeared,'' jackson said. ``we made a couple of mistakes and the context of the game changed entirely.''   without o'neal's presence in the middle, los angeles had trouble with the blazers' post players. portland held a 44-30 advantage in points in the paint and outrebounded the lakers 44-36.   shawn kemp  again provided a spark for the blazers, scoring 10 points -- eight in the fourth quarter.   ``you can't play this game and not get excited,'' kemp said. ``i miss being out there all the time, so you take advantage of the opportunities that youcome by now.'' notes  portland is 16-3 when scoring more than 100 points. the blazers have scored more than 100 points in their last eight home games, and are 7-1 in that stretch. ... the blazers are 22-14 against los angeles since the 1994-95season. ... stoudamire's 14 assists were a season high by portland.   email this story  - (view most popular)
ap photo more photos     by david droschak ap sports writer  february 18, 2002       winston-salem, n.c. (ap) -- it didn't take no. 19 wake forest long to analyze its previous two losses.   ``just too many points,'' craig dawson said of his team's defense.   the demon deacons scored 94 and 115 points against cincinnati and clemson, but lost both after allowing 103 and 118 -- the first time the program surrendered consecutive 100-point games since 1982-83.   ``we knew if we just guarded somebody and continued to score like we have, we'll win some basketball games,'' dawson said.   that was the formula sunday night as the demon deacons shot 58 percent and held down no. 15 virginia for a 92-70 victory.   darius songaila scored a career-high 30 points on near-perfect shooting, and craig dawson added 17 in the 22-point blowout.   the victory kept the demon deacons (18-8, 8-4) in third place in the atlantic coast conference, snapping a four-game skid against ranked teams.   songaila sank his first 10 shots and finished 11-for-13 from the field and 8-for-8 from the foul line, with 11 rebounds. his previous high point total was 29 against florida state this season.   virginia coach pete gillen called songaila ``a mangler'' last year at joel coliseum after the bruising inside player scored 27 points against the cavaliers on 11-of-12 shooting.   ``i haven't really thought about last year's comments,'' songaila said. ``if you let that bother you, it takes your focus away from the game. we just need to let things like that go. that's what i tried to do.''   dawson tied an acc record with 11 3-pointers in a 118-115 loss to clemson on wednesday night. against virginia, he was 5-for-9 on 3-pointers.   the cavaliers (16-7, 6-6), picked in the preseason to finish third in the acc, fell to .500 in the league and remained in fifth place with games left against duke and maryland -- the top two teams.   ``i know we're a better team than this, but we certainly didn't show it,'' gillen said.   roger mason jr. led the way with a career-high 31 points, but got little help from his teammates. mason's previous best was 30 against gonzaga last season.   once again, former acc rookie of the year and two-time all-acc player chris williams had a miserable time on the road. the senior forward was 0-for-8 from the field and finished with two points in 24 minutes.   ``we're not going to beat anybody in the acc if our all-league candidate gets two points,'' gillen said. ``i'm not blaming him. we lost as team, but we need him to give us what he can give us. he had a tough night. he wasn't the only one.''   wake forest didn't start its normal lineup, but it mattered little.   josh howard sat out with a bad left ankle, and vytas danelius started in place of antwan scott, who was late for practice. the freshman made the most of his first start with 13 points and eight rebounds.   virginia trailed by as many as 22 in the first half and closed within 13 twice early in the second period.   but the demon deacons went on a 14-4 run in the next four minutes to take a 71-48 lead with 12:10 left. dawson had a fast-break layup early in the spurt, then closed it with a 3-pointer.   ``we hit some cold-blooded shots, and it's always nice when the ball ends up in no. 25's hands,'' wake forest coach skip prosser said of songaila.   dawson and songaila did most of the offensive damage for wake forest in the opening half as songaila had 18 points, and dawson made four 3-pointers.   email this story  - (view most popular)

ap photo more photos       february 18, 2002       phoenix (ap) -- frank johnson found out in a hurry how tough it is to coach in the nba.   ``i was thinking about throwing it in, resigning after the second quarter,'' johnson said jokingly after the phoenix suns  lost 105-92 to the dallas mavericks  in his coaching debut sunday night.   johnson had reason to be upset by his team's performance in the second period, when the mavericks outscored the suns 33-11. apparently, he also was upset with star guard stephon marbury .   marbury, the suns' leading scorer with a 19.9 average, was benched at the start in favor of tony delk . marbury, who was late for sunday's shootaround, played only 14 minutes -- all in the first half -- and did not score, missing both field-goal attempts.   last week, marbury pleaded innocent to driving under the influence. he was arrested feb. 8.   johnson would not talk about marbury after the game, and marbury left the dressing room without speaking to the media.   after the suns raced to a 27-18 first-period lead, they wilted in the second quarter and fell behind by 15 points at halftime. they never got closer than 10 in the second half.   what turned the game was dallas switching from a man-to-man defense to a zone. when that happened, the suns couldn't cope.   the mavericks scored the final six points of the first period and the first 15 of the second, a 21-0 burst that covered nearly 6 1/2 minutes.   ``what hurt us was our second unit,'' johnson said. ``when i had the first unit in there, we were able to get some good stops and push the ball in an up-tempo game. on the defensive end, we held them to two layups in the first quarter. in the second quarter, they got eight or nine layups. our defense let us down ... a lot.''   penny hardaway also took note of the dropoff from the first unit to the second.   ``the first unit went out there and put a pretty impressive number on a good team,'' he said. ``then we came in with reserves, and we didn't have the same energy. everything dropped. they went on a run and we couldn't stop it.''   johnson, a former suns assistant and player, replaced scott skiles, who stepped down earlier in the day.   dirk nowitzki  scored 20 points, michael finley  19, steve nash  18 and reserve johnny newman  17 for dallas.   shawn marion  led the suns with 27 points, and delk had 26.   johnson's first move was to sit marbury and give delk his first start of the season. delk responded with 12 points in the first quarter, including three 3-pointers, as the suns opened a 27-12 lead in the first 10 minutes.   at that point, marbury replaced delk, and the mavericks turned the game around.   the run did not end until the suns' rodney rogers  hit a 3-pointer with 7:39 remaining in the second, cutting dallas' lead to 33-30.   as the half ended, one fan was heard to yell, ``you need a coach!'' many others in the crowd booed the home team loudly.   the mavs, who have been on the road for two weeks, appeared weary at the start, and the suns took advantage.   ``we only won one quarter. we won that substantially and just rode that thewhole game,'' dallas coach don nelson said. notes  this is the fifth time since 1986 that phoenix has had a coaching change in the middle of the season. in the previous four instances, the suns had a better record after the change. ... before sunday, the suns had won three straight over dallas and eight of nine at america west arena. ... dallas leads the nba in scoring with a 105.1 average. ... phoenix has not reached the100-point mark in its last six games.   email this story  - (view most popular)

''(jazz owner) larry miller rejected them all. he's made it clear that he'd never do it,'' said malone's agent, dwight manley.   but malone doesn't see it that way, and he claims to know the identity of some of the teams speaking with the jazz. the nba trading deadline is thursday.   ``i've heard a couple of them,'' malone said, refusing to be more specific.   ``i've got a no-trade (clause), so i'll make that call. we'll see what happens. nobody wants an old 38-year old broken down power forward. we'll see what happens by friday,'' he said.   malone had 27 points and 16 rebounds, rookie jarron collins  scored 19 and utah closed the game with a 16-5 run. the jazz played the sixth in a string of nine consecutive road games and won for the fourth straight time.   utah has defeated indiana, philadelphia, toronto and new york since the all-star break and can extend its winning streak to five monday night against cleveland.   the jazz will play two more road games after that, at denver on wednesday and at sacramento on feb. 26, before finally playing their next home game on the final day of february.   coach jerry sloan challenged his team at their morning shootaround, telling them that three straight road victories were nothing to celebrate at this stage of the season.   ``if the coach senses a team is too loose, he has to get on them -- and he did that,'' jazz guard john starks  said.   the knicks held 10-point leads in both the first and second quarters, but the jazz stayed within striking distance.   kurt thomas  scored off a rare offensive rebound (the knicks had only six), and allan houston , who scored 29, hit one of two from the line with 4:56 left for an 85-78 lead. utah scored eight of the next 10 points, with john stockton  scoring on a reverse layup that cut the knicks' lead to 87-86 with 2:45 left.   on their next possession, the jazz missed twice, but scott padgett  tipped in the second miss to give utah its first lead since early in the second quarter.   thomas then shot an airball, and malone found stockton for a layup with 3 seconds left on the shot clock for a 90-87 lead.   houston scored with 39 seconds left to make it a one-point game, and padgett missed a 3-pointer on utah's next possession.   after a timeout, houston let the clock wind down before taking a jumper that missed off the back rim. collins was fouled on the rebound with 3 seconds leftand made both foul shots. notes  the knicks shot 22-of-22 from the foul line before shandon anderson  missed with 7:08 left in the fourth. ... utah was just 17-of-29 from the line, but shot 8-for-9 in the fourth quarter. ... knicks center felton spencer  playedsix minutes in the second quarter and was whistled for five fouls.   email this story  - (view most popular)

ap photo more photos     by joseph white ap sports writer  february 19, 2002       washington (ap) -- an injured knee will force michael jordan  to skip a game for only the second time this season. the houston rockets  only wish they could be so lucky with their star player.   steve francis  was questionable before tipoff with yet another migraine headache, but he played in front of his hometown fans and scored 16 of his 20 points in the second half as the rockets upset the washington wizards  102-89 monday.   ``you can just see it on his face when he comes in and has that headache going,'' houston coach rudy tomjanovich said. ``we're always in the dark. we can't get our teeth into what our lineup's going to be. they came in today and asked who was starting and i said i didn't know yet -- and that was an hour before the game. i gave two different lineups.''   francis has missed five games this season because of migraines and 16 other games because a foot injury and the flu. the rockets are 3-19 when he doesn't start. had he missed monday's game, the local high school and university of maryland standout would have left a lot of people disappointed.   ``i wasn't going to walk out there,'' francis said. ``it was real close. but i had to -- it's the 35 tickets i bought. you've got to go out there.''   as for jordan, he scored only 11 points on 6-for-15 shooting and revealed afterward that he has had fluid buildup in his right knee. he said he will probably have it drained and will miss wednesday night's game at detroit.   ``i am 39,'' said jordan, whose birthday was sunday. ``and i've taken my body through a lot. it sends me signals, and i got to listen. i can't go against it.''   jordan has suffered from tendinitis in the knee all season and missed a game at san antonio on dec. 4. the injury was aggravated when he banged knees with teammate eton thomas in a game against sacramento before the all-star game, but jordan didn't feel the effects until this weekend.   ``the competitive nature sometimes is just to gut it out,'' said jordan, who plans to return for thursday's home game against new jersey. ``but if you're looking at the long haul ... you have to kind of use your head a little bit. it gives the team a little chance to go out and live on their own a little bit without their father being around.''   richard hamilton  scored 21 points, and chris whitney  had 19 for the wizards, who had won four straight at home and six of eight overall. jordan, playing the playmaker instead of the scorer because of his knee, had a season-high 11 assists.   ``i got into that passive mode and got everybody involved,'' jordan said. ``and i couldn't get out of it. they couldn't get out it.''   francis, cuttino mobley  and kenny thomas  scored all the points in 22-8 run that broke open a tight game and gave the rockets an 80-70 lead early in the fourth quarter.   mobley had 31 points, and thomas, whose jump shots kept houston in the game in the first half, finished with 21. moochie norris  added 15 points, 12 assistsand eight rebounds. notes  tomjanovich got his 450th nba victory, and it came on the 10th anniversary of his hiring as the rockets' coach. ... francis had his number ``honored'' at the university of maryland at the duke-maryland game on sunday, even though he only played a year for the terrapins. francis, who wore no. 23 at maryland, is the 12th maryland player to have his jersey honored -- the termused by the school because the number isn't actually retired.   email this story  - (view most popular)

ap photo more photos     by arnie stapleton ap sports writer  february 19, 2002       milwaukee (ap) -- the ailing milwaukee bucks  are falling in the eastern conference playoff race at the same time the charlotte hornets  are getting healthy.   jamal mashburn  showed no ill effects from his three-month layoff monday night, leading the hornets to a 101-92 victory over the bucks, who were without point guard sam cassell  for the third time in four games.   ``i didn't have much rust,'' mashburn said after logging 44 minutes in his return from a lower abdominal injury.   the hornets played with better poise and power with their leader back.   ``i've said so many times, you don't know what you miss until the guy comes back and gives you this kind of production,'' hornets coach paul silas said. ``he came back just at the right time.''   cassell has a sprained big toe that he guesses won't heal for three weeks. coach george karl plans to use him sparingly instead of putting him on the injured list.   without cassell, all nine bucks who played turned the ball over, led by ray allen  with six, as milwaukee lost for the ninth time in 12 games and fell into a tie with detroit atop the central division. the hornets pulled within 3 1/2 games.   ``what we've always worried about is now playing out, the one guy we couldn't afford to lose is sam,'' karl said.   with cassell hurt and milwaukee just 1-5 when backup rafer alston  starts, the bucks would love to land a backup point guard with playoff experience by thursday's trade deadline. but karl doesn't think that will happen.   only six players scored for the hornets, but all reached double figures, led by elden campbell  with 24. baron davis  had 20.   mashburn provided the kind of spark the hornets need to make another playoff run, adding five assists and three steals.   ``it's another playmaker out there,'' davis said. ``he takes a lot of pressure off me. i'm able to sometimes get a rest. the defense can't concentrate on just me and elden all the time.''   without cassell, milwaukee looked more like one of the nba's bottom-feeders than title favorites.   the bucks never led after the 1:03 mark of the first quarter and lost for the sixth time in eight home games.   ``it's disheartening to hear the fans boo,'' allen said.   the biggest jeers came when the bucks, normally a team panned for its propensity for jump shots, actually passed the ball too much, leading to turnovers and fast-break points for the hornets.   mashburn had 14 points by halftime, including 12 in the first quarter, as the hornets took a 56-46 lead at the break.   mashburn's biggest basket was his last, an 8-foot jumper that made it 99-92 with 39 seconds left.   silas said the bucks are still a team to worry about in the east, but karl admitted he's worried.   ``we don't have a swagger. we're not winning on our homecourt, but last time i checked we're still in first place. last time i checked, we still had the second-best home record in the eastern conference,'' karl said.   ``i don't want to rationalize because i don't think anybody should be happy with how we're playing, but we're still in good shape. we've just got to start winning at home and tread water, and hopefully sam gets back in the lineupsoon.'' notes  : mashburn was placed on the injured list on nov. 20 after he hurt himself trying to pivot during practice. ... allen, who led milwaukee with 27 points, was whistled for an uncharacteristic technical foul when he argued a non-call on a play in the third quarter in which he tripped and turned the ballover.   email this story  - (view most popular)
ap photo more photos       february 19, 2002       auburn hills, mich. (ap) -- the detroit pistons  needed most of the first half to show toronto that it was overmatched.   the undermanned raptors trailed the pistons by only six points with 30 seconds left in the first half, but a 3-pointer from jerry stackhouse  and a buzzer-beating jumper by cliff robinson sent detroit into halftime with a 50-39 lead.   ``that was important, because they were hanging around and hanging around,'' pistons coach rick carlisle said after the 89-76 victory monday night. ``the run at the end of the half gave us a cushion and it gave us some momentum. jerry hit a 3, then got a big steal to set up cliff's jumper. that was a nice way to finish the half.''   the win was detroit's ninth in 11 games and moved the pistons into a first-place tie with milwaukee atop the central division. the pistons have not been in first place this late in a season since their second championship season of 1989-90.   injuries have sidelined four of toronto's key players -- vince carter , hakeem olajuwon , dell curry  and jerome williams .   curry has missed five games with a calf strain, but toronto already has the maximum three players on the injured list, so they played with only 11 players on monday.   the raptors are 0-5 since carter went on the injured list with a quadriceps strain.   ``we just have to play our way through this,'' toronto coach lenny wilkens said. ``when you have as many people out as we do, you just have to keep working hard. we've got guys playing out of position, but they are getting experience.''   antonio davis  led the raptors with 21 points and 14 rebounds.   stackhouse finished with 21 points, and ben wallace  had 13 points and 13 rebounds for the pistons.   ``if ben is scoring double figures like he has been lately, we're just going to get on his back and ride him,'' stackhouse said. ``if he keeps this up, we might even start calling some plays for him.''   wallace was matched up against former pistons center eric montross , and wallace had 12 points and seven rebounds in the first half.   ``when eric was here last year, i had a lot of success with a couple moves against him in practice,'' he said. ``so i went to those moves and was able to hit some baskets.''   still, wallace's biggest role is on the defensive end. wallace leads the nba in blocks, is third in rebounds and 19th in steals.   ``ben is the guy who sets the tone for us,'' carlisle said. ``he's a monster on that end of the floor, so when he gets double figures in scoring, we're probably going to win the game.''   the teams meet again friday in toronto, and the raptors hope to have carter back.   ``this has been a challenge every night, but this experience is going to help us in the long run,'' raptors forward morris peterson  said. ``we are alljust going out there and trying to do everything we can to help us win.'' notes  peterson got a technical foul for a third-quarter dispute with zeljko rebraca . seconds later, peterson got a bloody nose in a collision with teammate mamadou n'diaye . ... the pistons have not had home-court advantage in a playoffseries since 1991.   email this story  - (view most popular)

ap photo more photos     by dan gelston associated press writer  february 20, 2002       indianapolis (ap) -- jalen rose  finally became a focal point for the indiana pacers , not as the all-star he always expected to be, but as part of seven-player trade with the chicago bulls .   the pacers on tuesday traded rose, travis best , rookie norman richardson and a conditional second-round draft pick to chicago for brad miller , ron mercer , ron artest  and kevin ollie .   rose was dealt only 1 1/2 years into a seven-year, $93 million contract he signed following the 2000 season. the deal has salary-cap implications -- the pacers cleared space to potentially re-sign jeff foster , jonathan bender  and jermaine o'neal , whose contracts expire after next season.   pacers president donnie walsh said he felt the trade would pay dividends in both the short and long term.   ``when you do a trade in the middle of the season, you're asking the coach a lot in putting the team together immediately,'' he said. ``i'm sure we're going to have some growing pains with this. but we didn't do the trade for just this year. we did it for the future.''   the pacers also rid themselves of the distraction of a rift between rose and coach isiah thomas. reports surfaced in december that rose was unhappy with his role after sitting out some fourth quarters. while both publicly denied a problem, rose's agent, david falk, blamed thomas for the trade.   ``i think he's disillusioned with his former coach,'' falk said. ``about 18 months ago, jalen recommended isiah as his coach. this is the way isiah reciprocated his loyalty.   ``he could have had jalen eating out of his hands, but instead he injected petty, personal issues that drove a wedge between them.''   walsh said tuesday night that he was the one responsible for the trade and insisted it was not made because of any problems between thomas and rose.   ``there was a time they were going through communication problems, but they got through that,'' walsh said. ``those are david's feelings. that isn't why we made this trade. i have a lot of respect for david and a deep feeling for jalen. in the end, i try to do what's best for the team.''   falk released a statement from rose, saying, ``in every adverse situation, successful people find opportunity.''   thomas was not immediately available for comment.   ``isiah has made a lot of assists during his career, but he never made a bigger one like he made to the bulls today,'' falk said.   the bulls hope rose can help resurrect the franchise. best, who saw his minutes cut following the emergence of rookie point guard jamaal tinsley , probably will start right away.   chicago general manager jerry krause said he tried to make a deal to get rose in the draft seven years ago, but it didn't work out. he said rose is going to make the bulls' two teen-agers -- tyson chandler  and eddie curry -- better players.   still, the price was steep. the bulls traded their top three scorers, who accounted for nearly 59 percent of their 86.3 points per game.   ``we hated to trade artest, miller, mercer and ollie, but to get quality, you have to give quality,'' krause said.   walsh has now practically dismantled the pacers team that reached the nba finals two years ago. only reggie miller  and austin croshere  were significant contributors to that team who remain on the roster.   miller said it was tough to see best and rose go because they helped shape the team.   ``we're bringing pieces to the puzzle that we lack,'' miller said. ``we're getting some size. now we can return jermaine to his rightful position. that makes us much more bigger, tougher and a better rebounding team. but until you get that chemistry, it's hard to tell.''   o'neal will move to his more natural power forward position, with miller becoming the center. thomas said he would slot bender into rose's small forward spot.   mercer has already been traded three times during his 4 1/2 seasons in the nba, but was leading the bulls in scoring, averaging 16.8 points. miller averaged 12.7 points and 8.4 rebounds for chicago. artest, in his third season, averaged 15.6 points.   ollie, chicago's starting point guard since greg anthony  was injured in january, will replace best as the backup point guard.   email this story  - (view most popular)

(ap) -- nearly unbeatable as an amateur, tiger woods  was asked a few years ago what was different about match play as a professional.   ``the field,'' he replied.   that's never more true than at the match play championship, a free-for-all among the top 64 players available in the world ranking that starts wednesday at la costa resort.   how fickle is this format?   woods is the only player among the top 16 seeds who has even reached the final in the first three years of the accenture match play championship.   ``the fields are so deep that anybody can beat anybody at any given time,'' woods said. ``this format, as you've seen in the past, is a perfect illustration of that -- guys getting knocked out who are the higher seeds early in the tournament, just because these guys are all good.''   it was never that way as an amateur, where woods won three straight u.s. junior amateurs, then a record-setting three straight u.s. amateurs.   then he turned pro.   his match-play record is a respectable 13-4 (14-5 including the ``showdown at sherwood'' victory over david duval  and the ``battle at bighorn'' loss against sergio garcia ), but his only real victories came in singles at the presidents cup and ryder cup.   woods was knocked out by jeff maggert  and his magnificent wedge game in the quarterfinals in 1999, the inaugural match play event. darren clarke  wiped him out, 4 and 3, in the final two years ago at la costa.   woods played a purer form of match play, 36 holes per match, at the world match play championship in england three years ago and was beaten by his buddy, mark o'meara , on the final hole at wentworth.   that explains why he studied the pairings after a practice round wednesday and wouldn't let his eyes wander too far along the brackets. first up is peter o'malley  of australia, the no. 64 seed. that's all that matters.   it usually takes three rounds or more for a player to get wrapped up in a match-play situation, like woods against bob may  in the pga championship at valhalla, or phil mickelson  against david toms  last year in the pga.   head-to-head play starts for the 64 players wednesday when they get to the first tee and shake hands with their opponents.   what to expect? anything.   just ask steve flesch , who traveled halfway around the world to australia last year and was 5-under after playing nine holes in the first round -- and he was 2-down to per-ulrik johansson , who was 10 under through 14 holes when he closed out flesch.   ``all i remember is that it was a long way to go to shoot 5-under in nine holes and have to go home,'' flesch said. ``but that's the fickle nature of match play.''   woods took particular notice of toms, the no. 6 seed, going up against no. 59 rory sabbatini  of south africa, whose only pga tour victory came two years ago in british columbia. sabbatini finished one stroke behind last week at riviera and was three strokes behind the week before in san diego.   ``look at this one,'' woods said. ``as good as rory has been playing lately, that would not really be an upset.''   ap photo
